# Time series Prediction on California Home sales

With 54 of the Fortune 500 companies headquartered in California, like Google, Apple, Disney, Oracle and Intel among others, California is positioned for continued job growth. High employment rates draw renters and buyers and, for investors, enhance the likelihood of consistent cash flow. Though not the lowest in the country, California has favorable property tax rates, which will help control investorsâ€™ expenses and improve cash flow. The combination of job growth and a world-renowned lifestyle and culture supports home values. People buy where they want to live, and millions of people want to live in California. All of the demand mentioned above also leads to increasing home values.


## Business Problem

This platform allows the public to do independent research in any market in the US.

This dataset contains 14723 rows and 272 columns.

## Further Study

- The model is unable to correctly adjust to unique events such as exogenous data. Interest rates, rent values and GDP would be important factors to explore the relationship they would have with the home values. Rent income should exceed the costs of maintenance, mortgage, insurance, taxes and other expenses. Any gains that may be realized from selling the property later should also be factored into the calculation.


- Model would be more effective with more recent years data and considering the impact of recent events on Real Estate Business.
