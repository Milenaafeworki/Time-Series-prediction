With 54 of the Fortune 500 companies headquartered in California, like Google, Apple, Disney, Oracle and Intel among others, California is positioned for continued job growth. High employment rates draw renters and buyers and, for investors, enhance the likelihood of consistent cash flow. Though not the lowest in the country, California has favorable property tax rates, which will help control investorsâ€™ expenses and improve cash flow. The combination of job growth and a world-renowned lifestyle and culture supports home values. People buy where they want to live, and millions of people want to live in California. All of the demand mentioned above also leads to increasing home values.


## Business Problem

A real estate company is looking to flip homes, what are the top 5 zip codes to invest in? How will we scale our data? What defines best?

For this dataset, we will only include data from CA. Because of the housing market crash, any modelling that uses only recent years may be misleading. We will use every value from 1996 to 2018 so we can have the most accurate picture of home values in CA through the years.

This platform allows the public to do independent research in any market in the US.

This dataset contains 14723 rows and 272 columns.
